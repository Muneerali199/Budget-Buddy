# üîí Security Policy

Budget Buddy takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, how to report vulnerabilities, and what we do to protect your financial data.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

### Data Protection
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: We cannot access your financial data
- **Secure Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication and secure session management
- **Regular Security Audits**: Continuous monitoring and vulnerability assessments

### Compliance
- **SOC 2 Type II** compliant infrastructure (via Supabase)
- **GDPR** compliant data handling
- **PCI DSS** guidelines for financial data
- **ISO 27001** security standards

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### Supported Authentication Methods
- ‚úÖ Email/Password with verification
- ‚úÖ Google OAuth 2.0
- ‚úÖ GitHub OAuth
- ‚úÖ Magic Link authentication
- üîÑ Two-Factor Authentication (Coming Soon)

### Session Security
- JWT tokens with automatic refresh
- Secure session storage
- Automatic logout on inactivity
- Device-based session management

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All database operations are protected by Supabase RLS policies:

```sql
-- Users can only access their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own transactions" 
ON transactions FOR ALL 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own budgets" 
ON budgets FOR ALL 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Security

### Encryption
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 encryption for all API calls
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for database storage
- **API Keys**: Encrypted storage of third-party API keys
- **Backups**: Encrypted automated backups

### Data Minimization
- Only collect necessary financial data
- No storage of sensitive payment information
- Automatic data retention policies
- User-controlled data deletion

### Privacy Controls
- **Data Export**: Download all your data anytime
- **Data Deletion**: Permanent account and data deletion
- **Granular Permissions**: Control what data is shared
- **Audit Logs**: Track all data access and modifications

## üö® Vulnerability Reporting

### Responsible Disclosure
We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Do NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. **Do NOT** test vulnerabilities on our production systems
3. **Do** report vulnerabilities through our secure channels

## üèÜ Security Rewards

### Bug Bounty Program
We offer rewards for valid security vulnerabilities:

| Severity | Reward Range |
|----------|--------------|
| Critical | $500 - $2,000 |
| High | $200 - $500 |
| Medium | $50 - $200 |
| Low | $25 - $50 |

### Recognition

- LinkedIn recommendation
- Public acknowledgment in release notes

### Eligibility
- First valid report of the vulnerability
- Follows responsible disclosure guidelines
- Provides clear reproduction steps
- Does not violate our terms of service

## üîß Security Best Practices
